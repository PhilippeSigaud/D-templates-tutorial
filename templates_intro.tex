Templates are a central feature of D, giving you powerful compile-time code generation abilities that'll make your code cleaner, more flexible and even more efficient. They are used everywhere in \href{http://www.dlang.org/phobos/}{Phobos}\index{Phobos}, the D standard library and any D user should know about them. But, based on C++\index{C++}'s templates as they are, they can be a bit daunting at first. The \href{http://www.dlang.org}{D Programming Language} website's \href{http://www.dlang.org/template.html}{documentation} is a good start, though its description of templates is spread among many different files and (as it's a language reference) its material doesn't so much \emph{teach} you how to use templates as \emph{show} you their syntax and semantics.

This document aims to be a kind of tutorial on D templates, to show the beginning D coder what can be achieved with them. When I was doing C++\index{C++}, I remember \emph{never} using templates for more than \emph{containers-of-T} stuff, and considered Boost-level\footnote{ The \href{http://www.boost.org}{Boost}\index{Boost} C++ library collection makes heavy use of templates.} metaprogramming the kind of code I could never understand, never mind produce. Well, D's sane syntax for templates, nifty things like \D{static if}, \D{alias} or tuples cured me of that impression. I hope this document will help you also.

\section*{What's in This Document}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{What's in This Document}

\autoref{basics} deals with the very basics: how to declare and instantiate a template, the standard `building blocks' you'll use in almost all your templates, along with function (\ref{functiontemplates}), struct (\ref{structtemplates}) and class (\ref{classtemplates}) templates. Throughout the text, examples will present applications of these concepts. 

\autoref{advanced} is about more advanced topics a D template user will probably use, but not on a daily basis, like template constraints (\ref{constraints}), mixin templates (\ref{mixintemplates}) or operator overloading (\ref{operatoroverloading}). 

\autoref{around} presents other meta\-pro\-gram\-ming tools: string mixins (\ref{stringmixins}), compile-time function evaluation (\ref{ctfe}) and \D{\_\_traits} (\ref{traits}). These are seen from a template-y point of view: how they can interact with templates and what you can build with them in conjunction with templates.

\autoref{examples} presents more developed examples of what can be done with templates, based on real needs I had at some time and that could be fulfilled with templates.

Finally, an appendix (\autoref{isexpression}) on the ubiquitous \D{is} expression  completes this document.

\section*{Conventions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Conventions}

In this doc:

\begin{itemize}
\item D keywords will be marked like this: \D{int}, \D{static if}, \D{\_\_traits}.
\item Symbols and names used in code samples and cited in the text will be written like this: \DD{myFunc}, \DD{flatten}.
\item internal links will be in red, like this (\ref{basics}).
\item external links will be in blue, like \href{http://www.dlang.org}{this}.
\end{itemize}

Syntax-highlighted code samples are shown like this:

\begin{dcode}
import std.stdio;

// This is a comment
void hello(uint times)
{
    foreach(i; 0..times) writeln("Hello, Word!");
}
\end{dcode}

For those of you interested by \LaTeX, this document uses the \href{http://code.google.com/p/minted/}{minted}\index{minted (LaTex package)@\DD{minted} (\LaTeX\ package)} package for the code samples. They may be wider than the main text, but that's to get about 80-chars-long lines. And no, for the time being I'll just respect the standard \LaTeX\ text width, unless many people complain about it.

I will sometimes make a little aparte, discussing a small piece of info too small to be in its own section. These will be marked so:

\aparte{What's with all that red and blue?}{What, don't you like having red links and blue keywords in your text?}

Finally, some sections in this doc are not finished yet. The sections I consider unfinished will begin with a friendly frame:

\unfinished{That's also true for this very intro. I should have a 'Thanks' subsection where I list people that contributed to this text.}
